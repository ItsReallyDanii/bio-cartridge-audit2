# Audit Definition

## Objective
Evaluate water and aerosol capture performance using probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation with auditor-visible risk breakpoints.

## Core Risk Metrics
- Re-entrainment probability
- SNR collapse probability
- Saturation probability

## Acceptance Principles
- Non-negativity of masses
- Capacity clamping for water ledger
- Monotonic accumulation for aerosol and species ledgers
- Provenance attached to every run
