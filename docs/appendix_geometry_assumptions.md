# Appendix: Geometry Assumptions

- Boundary layer effects are folded into effective coefficients.
- Surface chemistry is treated as inert in current scope.
- Regime extrapolation outside documented Re/Stk ranges is not validated.
- Saturation is modeled as hard cap (`M_max`) without film-flow submodel.
