# Validation Notes (v0.2.1)

Sensitivity (highest first):
1. Particle diameter (`d_p`) via `Stk ~ d_p^2`
2. Characteristic length (`L`)
3. Air velocity (`v_air`)

Regime notes:
- Low velocity: diffusion/interception dominate.
- Nominal velocity: report `Stk` as a range (not a point).
- High velocity: higher capture potential with re-entrainment risk.
